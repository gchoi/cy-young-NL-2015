Visualizing the 2015 National League Cy Young Race
==================================================

Originally, I started digging into this data in attempt to show that Jake
Arrieta should win the 2015 NL Cy Young. However, the data showed that it was
difficult to make that case with a straight face.

Instead, I did a bunch of analysis around each of Arrieta, Greinke, and
Kershaw's seasons and made some fun plots to show how their seasons progressed.

This repo contains all the code and data for that analysis.

Since it was originally for my eyes only, I didn't comment or clean it up much,
so there might be some things that don't make sense to third parties.
